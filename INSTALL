PLEASE CONSULT YOUR DBA BEFORE INSTALLING THIS SOFTWARE!!!

 1) If you are using DBD::Oracle 1.14 or earlier, upgrade to 1.15.
 2) Set the ORACLE_HOME environment variable to the proper path.
 3) perl Makefile.PL -- follow the instructions
 4) make
 5) su root
 6) make install
 7) Configure the listener for external procedures (see the user's guide for
    details or have a DBA configure this for you)
 8) Edit extproc_perl.conf in the installation directory and make any changes
    you deem necessary.  The defaults should suffice for the first run though.
    See the user's guide for more details on this file.
 9) Connect to your database with sqlplus.  Login with a user/schema that
    you want to own the Perl package, tables, and views.
10) Run ep_package.sql by typing @ep_package
11) Run ep_schema.sql by typing @ep_schema
12) Restrict delete, truncate, insert, and update privileges on the code table
    as you (or your DBA) see fit.
13) Grant select privilege on the code table to all users who will run Perl
    procedures.  DO NOT assign roles for this privilege (including 'public'),
    as roles will not be honored if you define a Perl procedure in a PL/SQL
    package.
