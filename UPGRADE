From 1.99_07 and earlier:

The extproc_perl schema has changed.  Running @ep_schema from sqlplus will
apply the changes to the views, but not to the code table.  Instead of dropping
and adding the table and losing your code, run @migrate-1_99_07 from sqlplus,
which will convert your code table.

From 1.99_06 and earlier:

Build and install extproc_perl as usual.  There were numerous bug fixes in the
C wrapper code for directly executed procedures, so you will need to recreate
the wrappers using Perl.create_wrapper and relink using "make -f perlxsi.mk".

From 1.03 and earlier:

There is no direct upgrade path, but this should get you going.  Back up all
your Perl source.  Install extproc_perl 2.0 using a different bootstrap file
and a different name for the code table as you did for 1.03 (or use a different
schema).  Update your code to work with changes to the ExtProc module and
reimport your code.
