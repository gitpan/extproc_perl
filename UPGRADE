From 1.99_07 and earlier:

The extproc_perl schema has changed.  Running @ep_schema from sqlplus will
apply the changes to the views, but not to the code table.  Instead of dropping
and adding the table and losing your code, run @migrate-1_99_07 from sqlplus,
which will convert your code table.

From 1.99_06 and earlier:

Build and install extproc_perl as usual.  There were numerous bug fixes in the
C wrapper code for directly executed procedures, so you will need to recreate
the wrappers using Perl.create_wrapper and relink using "make -f perlxsi.mk".
