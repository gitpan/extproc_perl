From 1.99_07 and earlier:

The extproc_perl schema has changed.  Running @ep_schema from sqlplus will
apply the changes to the views, but not to the code table.  Instead of dropping
and adding the table and losing your code, use the following alter table
statements to bring you up to date (replace your-code-table as appropriate):

alter table your-code-table add plsql_spec varchar(255);
alter table your-code-table drop column last_modified_user;
alter table your-code-table drop column last_modified_date;

From 1.99_06 and earlier:

Build and install extproc_perl as usual.  There were numerous bug fixes in the
C wrapper code for directly executed procedures, so you will need to recreate
the wrappers using Perl.create_wrapper and relink using "make -f perlxsi.mk".
