# extproc_perl configuration

### GENERAL CONFIGURATION ###

# format: key value
# comment out all empty settings with a hash (#)

# path to bootstrap file
bootstrap_file -BOOTSTRAP-

# name of the code table, including schema if it is not a public synonym
code_table -CODETABLE-

# additions to perl's include path (@INC) -- colon separated
#inc_path 

# path to debug output directory
debug_directory /tmp

### SECURITY ###

# use taint checking -- this applies globally to all subroutines
# HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
enable_tainting yes

### EXPERIMENTAL
# use per-session namespaces
enable_session_namespace yes

# allow fully-qualified subroutine names in Perl.func & Perl.proc
# this lets you run any subroutine in any imported package, regardless of
# its existence as in the code table or bootstrap file.  Very useful for
# development.  Not recommended for production.
enable_package_subs no

# path to trusted directory that contains imported code files
trusted_code_directory -TRUSTEDDIR-

### TUNABLES ###

# maximum code size per subroutine in bytes
# must be less than or equal to max size of VARCHAR2 (4000)
# allocated once per interpreter
max_code_size 4000

# maximum arguments to a subroutine (<=  system max, which is usually 128)
# there is currently no benefit to tuning this
max_sub_args 32
