Oracle Perl Procedure Library

Copyright (c) 2001 Jeff Horwitz (jeff@smashing.org).  All rights reserved.
This package is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the same terms as Perl itself.

extproc_perl enables Oracle stored procedures and functions to be written
in Perl.  It uses Oracle 8's external procedure interface to create Perl
interpreters on the fly to execute Perl subroutines.

Please send all bug reports, questions and suggestions to jeff@smashing.org.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
o Perl 5.005_62 or later (built and tested with 5.6.1)
o shared libperl
o Oracle 8 server with OCI development libraries and headers (built and
  tested with 8.1.7 -- may work with earlier versions)

BUILDING & INSTALLATION
-----------------------
This is quick and dirty.  See the INSTALL file for more detailed information.

 1) set the ORACLE_HOME environment variable to the proper path
 2) perl Makefile.PL
 3) enter the list of Perl modules you'd like to support
 4) make -- this will build extproc_perl and the ExtProc Perl module
 5) make install -- this will install the ExtProc Perl module
 6) copy the extproc_perl library (name is platform-dependent, but it's
    probably extproc_perl.so) to a location that an Oracle process can
    access.
 7) create a bootstrap file containing the Perl subroutines you wish to run
    from Oracle.
 8) have your DBA create an Oracle function that references the code in the
    library.  see extproc_perl.sql for sample code.
 9) have your DBA start a listener for extproc connections.

BUGS & CAVEATS
--------------
* You must end the boostrap file with "return 1;" or the embedded interpreter
  will barf.  This may break testing with "perl -cw".
* Since modules are statically compiled into the binary, you must recompile
  in order to use any new modules installed since the last compile.  This
  only applies to modules with shared object code (usually compiled from C).
