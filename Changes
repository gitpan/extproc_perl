1.03	Thu Jul 31 18:10:28 EDT 2003
	* New 'config' option to ep will configure the database for you
	* ep is now autogenerated from ep.in
	* added POD documentation for ep
	* make install now installs ep & extproc_perl.so for you

1.02	Sun Jul 20 13:24:29 EDT 2003
	* ExtProc::ep_debug should is now a no-op when debugging is not
	  enabled
	* Running _codetable as a procedure no longer returns an "INVALID
	  SUBROUTINE" error
	* fixed reset of codetable when new interpreter is started
	* A test suite is now included for "make test"
	* _version now returns configuration options in addition to version
	* ExtProc module is now linked statically (no .so files) into
          extproc_perl.  This prevents version conflicts and facilitates
          testing outside of production.

1.01	Wed Jun 18 13:04:17 EDT 2003
	* Tainting configuration option now sets CC defines properly
	* Fixed tainted eval failure when loading code from database
	* Updated some old callback documentation

1.0	Thu May 22 16:24:50 EDT 2003
	* UPDATED LICENSE -- commercial redistribution requires approval
	* _eval function returns proper return value from code
	* Added internal debugging facility
	* Added _enable_debug and _disable_debug special subroutines to toggle
	  debugging status
	* STDERR is redirected to log file when debugging is enabled
	* Added appropriate CC optimization flags during compilation
	* New option to enable taint checks
	* Makefile.PL now checks for threads-enabled Perl
	* Makefile.PL asks about enabling debugging

0.97	Mon Apr 21 21:25:31 EDT 2003
	* New DBD::Oracle patch allows passing of existing handles in place
	  of a new context.  This fixes the multiple query problem in 0.96.
	* Added significant infrastructure to the extproc_perl core to save
	  the state of OCI handles for passing to DBD::Oracle in
	  multiple-query transactions
	* New ExtProc->dbi_connect() wraps DBI->connect and encapsulates
	  the logic used in context/handle passing to DBD::Oracle

0.96	Wed Apr 16 11:00:58 EDT 2003
	* Make code compliant with Perl's threading context API
	* New patch to fix broken DBD-Oracle 1.13 & 1.14
	* _errno() special subroutine returns $!
	* _eval() special subroutine evals code with non-fatal failure
	  semantics
	* Update documentation for threading perl warning and new functions

0.95	Sat Apr 12 13:03:20 EDT 2003
	* Added support for calling a Perl subroutine as a procedure
	* Procedural calls enable support of DML statements from the
	  external procedure
	* Added Fcntl as a default built-in module
	* Can add to default module list instead of replacing it
	* _preload() special subroutine forces loading of code from database
	* Updated documentation

0.94	Fri Nov 22 13:58:08 EST 2002
	* Renamed "context" attribute to "ora_context" in DBD::Oracle patch
	  on Tim Bunce's suggestion
	* Retrieve code from database in addition to bootstrap file
	* Query database for code when get_cv fails
	* Bootstrap file is now optional
	* _codetable() special subroutine sets or returns database table
	  that is queried for code
	* _modules() special subroutine returns statically linked modules
	* _error() special subroutine returns most recent error string
	* Rewrote ExtProc module convenience functions to use OCI simple_query
	  interface.  This removes the DBI dependency of the ExtProc module,
          which was a performance hit on initial load.
	* Wrote "ep" script to import and export code from a database.

0.93	Fri Aug 31 11:16:39 EDT 2001
	* Wrote patch for DBD-Oracle to work inside an external procedure
	* Rewrote convenience ExtProc functions in Perl using DBI
	* Added a context method to ExtProc that returns the current
	  OCIExtProcContext object used in DBI calls.

0.92	Thu Aug 23 17:20:00 EDT 2001 (INTERNAL RELEASE)
	* Fixed "return 1" bug -- reversed logic in perl_run call
	* use get_cv to test for subroutine existence

0.91	Mon Aug 20 15:59:57 EDT 2001
	* Update documentation for persistence and special functions

0.90	Wed Aug 15 15:17:54 EDT 2001
	* Initial revision
