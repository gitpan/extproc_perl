0.95	Sat Apr 12 13:03:20 EDT 2003
	* Added support for calling a Perl subroutine as a procedure
	* Procedural calls enable support of DML statements from the
	  external proceudure
	* Added Fcntl as a default built-in module
	* Can add to default module list instead of replacing it
	* _preload() special subroutine forces loading of code from database
	* Updated documentation

0.94	Fri Nov 22 13:58:08 EST 2002
	* Renamed "context" attribute to "ora_context" in DBD::Oracle patch
	  on Tim Bunce's suggestion
	* Retrieve code from database in addition to bootstrap file
	* Query database for code when get_cv fails
	* Bootstrap file is now optional
	* _codetable() special subroutine sets or returns database table
	  that is queried for code
	* _modules() special subroutine returns statically linked modules
	* _error() special subroutine returns most recent error string
	* Rewrote ExtProc module convenience functions to use OCI simple_query
	  interface.  This removes the DBI dependency of the ExtProc module,
          which was a performance hit on initial load.
	* Wrote "ep" script to import and export code from a database.

	  OCIExtProcContext object used in DBI calls.

	* Fixed "return 1" bug -- reversed logic in perl_run call
	* use get_cv to test for subroutine existence
