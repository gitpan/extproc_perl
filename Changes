0.94	Fri Nov 22 13:58:08 EST 2002
	* Renamed "context" attribute to "ora_context" in DBD::Oracle patch
	  on Tim Bunce's suggestion
	* Retrieve code from database in addition to bootstrap file
	* Query database for code when get_cv fails
	* Bootstrap file is now optional
	* _codetable() special subroutine sets or returns database table
	  that is queried for code
	* _modules() special subroutine returns statically linked modules
	* _error() special subroutine returns most recent error string
	* Rewrote ExtProc module convenience functions to use OCI simple_query
	  interface.  This removes the DBI dependency of the ExtProc module,
          which was a performance hit on initial load.
	* Wrote "ep" script to import and export code from a database.

0.93	Fri Aug 31 11:16:39 EDT 2001
	* Wrote patch for DBD-Oracle to work inside an external procedure
	* Rewrote convenience ExtProc functions in Perl using DBI
	* Added a context method to ExtProc that returns the current
	  OCIExtProcContext object used in DBI calls.

0.92	Thu Aug 23 17:20:00 EDT 2001 (INTERNAL RELEASE)
	* Fixed "return 1" bug -- reversed logic in perl_run call
	* use get_cv to test for subroutine existence

0.91	Mon Aug 20 15:59:57 EDT 2001
	* Update documentation for persistence and special functions
